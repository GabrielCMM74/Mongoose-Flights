 <div><form action="/flights/<%= dest._id %>?_method=DELETE"
                class="delete-form" method="POST">
                <button type="submit">Delete <%= dest.airport %>  <%= dest.arrival %></button>
              </form></div>


So with post man you can just identify specific routes 
make requests that help with api 
res.send will detect the content temp 
res.json will send json ({ msg: 'Whatever'})
The net work tab will send quite a bit of information and relaod with cached showing not modified 

can also do post request ensuring the middle ware from express is their for forms and json 
can even get the content type/

postman is basically just an amazing way to simulate what you are trying to do 
You can create different routes depending on request of what is happening. 

Another way of simulating post 

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded ({ extended: false }));
app.post('/contact', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.body.name) {
    return res.status (400).send ( 'Name is required');
 // DATABASE STUFF
  res.status (201).send(Thank you ${req.body.namel);
});\


auth 

app. post('/login', (req, res) => {
 if(!req. header('x-auth-token')) {
    return res.status(400).send ( 'No Token');
 if(req. header ('x-auth-token') !== '123456') {
    return res.status (401).send ( 'Not authorized');
  }
  res.send( 'Logged in');
  

  Yeah idk anymore. thought it was making sense but now im more confused so well f me. 
  I need to understand routes much better
  So yeah this is a thing 
Its all good 
So async can be written as function expressions. and more
